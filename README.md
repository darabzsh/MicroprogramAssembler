## Overview

The compiler processes the microcode instructions and simulates the execution of each instruction, updating the values of the registers as per the microinstructions.

## Usage

To use this simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/darabzsh/MicroprogramAssembler.git`
2. Navigate to the directory that contains the executable file: `cd MicroprogramAssembler/exe`
3. Run the simulator: `./Assembler.exe`
